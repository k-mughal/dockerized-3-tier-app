## This project serves as an operational illustration for a multi-container, three-tier web application. 
  ### 1. Dockerized Application for Linux
  - Is versatile, capable of running on either Linux or Windows Docker desktop environments.
   - The application is a fully operational instance of a three-tier, multi-container setup. It integrates React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and PostgreSQL as the database, all managed by the Nginx reverse proxy.
