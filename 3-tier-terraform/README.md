This Terraform project is designed to automate the provisioning of a comprehensive three-tier infrastructure on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The infrastructure setup encompasses the following key components:

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud, providing a virtual network for resources to operate within.

2. **Public and Private Subnets:** Segmentation of the VPC into public and private subnetworks, allowing for controlled access and enhanced security. Public subnets are accessible from the internet, while private subnets are isolated and accessible only internally.

3. **Security Groups:** Defining security policies and rules to regulate inbound and outbound traffic to instances within the infrastructure, ensuring a secure environment.

4. **NAT Gateway and Elastic IP Address:** Facilitating outbound internet connectivity for instances located in private subnets, while maintaining a fixed public IP address for essential services.

5. **Frontend Server and NGINX Server in Public Subnet:** Deploying instances hosting the frontend application and NGINX server in the public subnet, enabling direct access from the internet.

6. **Backend Server and PostgreSQL Database in Private Subnet:** Setting up instances hosting the backend application and a PostgreSQL database in the private subnet, ensuring heightened security by restricting external access.

7. **Cloning and Installing Frontend and Backend Applications:** Replicating and deploying frontend and backend applications onto the respective instances in the public and private subnets, providing redundancy and scalability.

By automating the deployment process through Terraform, this project streamlines the creation and management of the three-tier infrastructure, fostering efficiency, consistency, and reliability in AWS environments.
